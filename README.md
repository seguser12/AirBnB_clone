# AirBnB_clone
## Description
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
It will be used with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…
It's a shell built for specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
